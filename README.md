# Watch2Gether_Parser

This console application uses Selenium WebDriver to visit a website, click a button, and then parse title data contained within an iframe.
Then, it creates a local server and sets the HTTP response to an HTML element containing the title text.

Intended to be used in conjunction with a StreamLabs OBS web source widget to display the currently playing video on a stream.
